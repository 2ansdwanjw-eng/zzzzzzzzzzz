# Icon Files Needed

For the Chrome extension to work properly, you need to create the following icon files:

- icon16.png (16x16 pixels)
- icon48.png (48x48 pixels) 
- icon128.png (128x128 pixels)

These should be PNG files with a simple icon representing the extension (e.g., a treasure chest, coins, or crown symbol).

You can create these icons using any image editor or download free icons from sites like:
- Flaticon.com
- Icons8.com
- Iconfinder.com

Place the icon files in the same directory as the manifest.json file.

Until you add the icon files, the extension will work but may show a default placeholder icon.
